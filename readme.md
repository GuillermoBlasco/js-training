# JS training

Hello there! This is a repository with few js training projects :)

## Requirements

You should have NodeJs installed, that is `node` and `npm`. 
To verify that you have that installed run in the command line:
```shell script
node
```

and you should see which version is installed and the nodejs
interpreter line. Then you can exit that with `ctrl+c` twice.
Also you can run `node --version` to check the version.
Then to verify `npm` is installed simply run `npm --version`.

## How to use each training

Each training contains an `index.js` file that is where you
should add the code! also there is a `readme.md` with the
context and explanation of the problem. Finally, there is a 
`index.test.js` with few tests to verify that you found a 
solution!

To run the tests you can use `npm`.

```shell script
npm install
npm test
```

Then you'll see the set of tests that pass and the ones that don't.
