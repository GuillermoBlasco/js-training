This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Welcome to the counter exercise

In this exercise you'll learn how to give action to a button and play with useState. <br />
Here you'll find a value starting at 0 and you should give the necessary actions to 
the button to make the value increment or decrement in each case. 

You just need to edit the App.js file to make that possible.




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
