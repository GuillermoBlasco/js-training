# 1.2. Repeating Tasks

## Problem

We are scheduling tasks for a team. The tasks follow a pattern
like "5 times every two working days starting on 2020-01-01", 
or "2 times every six working days starting on 2020-02-15".
The function should return the array of days (as strings) when tasks
 should happen ordered from closest to the present to farthest.
 
 Consider that sundays and saturdays are not working days. Therefore
 should not be counted when scheduling the tasks.
