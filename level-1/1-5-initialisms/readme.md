# 1.5. Initialisms

Phrases can be initialised to shorten them. Initialise usually
means to take the first letter of each word. Sometimes adding
dots, sometimes capitalising the nouns.

For the purpose of this exercise we are going to shorten any
phrase by taking the first letter as uppercase. Something like:

```shell script
The cat is staring -> TCIS
World united -> WU
```

Consider that the test set has some trickery to represent situations
you may find when dealing with human inputted strings. Like more than
one space.
