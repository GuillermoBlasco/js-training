# 1.7. Validate Sudokus

## Problem
Sudokus are a well-known time-killer puzzle. Sudokus are a 9x9 grid with 
numbers from 1 to 9. There are a few rules to validate that a sudoku is ok.
The rules are:
- in each column no numbers should repeat
- in each row no numbers should repeat
- in each 3x3 square no numbers should repeat

This exercise takes as an input a sudoku partially filled with numbers 1 to 9
and 0 where the values is not set, and outputs true if the sudoku is valid, false
otherwise.
